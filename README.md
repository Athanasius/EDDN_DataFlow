As I kept seeing people confuse EDDB with EDDN, and in general not know
how game data gets from players to the various third party sites I've
made an infrographic.

As per the notes at the bottom this doesn't cover every possible
interaction between every possible tool and every possible website. It's
intended to just make it clear what the general flow is.
